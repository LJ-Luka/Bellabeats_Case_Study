# Capstone Project: Bellabeat Case Study

The project was a case study done to wrap up the Google Data Analytics certificate. It tested skills I picked up during the 8 part course - the 8th being the capstone project.

## Summary

Founded in 2013 by Urska Srsen and Sando Mur, Bellabeats is a tech-driven health and wellness company that manufactures smart products to enable women to track their health and habits based on their activity, stress, sleep and reproductive health.
Srsen, the Chief Creative officer, knows that growth opportunities would be revealed from an analysis of Bellabeat's customer data. She wants the marketing analytics team, in which I am a junior data analyst to analyse usage data of non-Bellabeat smart devices while focusing on a Bellabeat product. The purpose is to gain insights into how those other devices are being used by customers and apply the insights to the Bellabeat product.

## Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.
The marketing analytics team was asked to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, we are expected to come up with a high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

Using the steps in the data analysis process, Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act, the task was completed. See technical report [here](https://github.com/LJ-Luka/Bellabeats_Case_Study/blob/main/technical.md).
