## Summary

Founded in 2013 by Urska Srsen and Sando Mur, Bellabeats is a
tech-driven health and wellness company that manufactures smart products
to enable women to track their health and habits based on their
activity, stress, sleep and reproductive health. Srsen, the Chief
Creative officer, knows that growth opportunities would be revealed from
an analysis of Bellabeat's customer data. She wants the marketing
analytics team, in which I am a junior data analyst to analyse usage
data of non-Bellabeat smart devices while focusing on a Bellabeat
product. The purpose is to gain insights into how those other devices
are being used by customers and apply the insights to the Bellabeat
product.

**Problem statement:**  
To analyse smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers
use smart devices and apply these insights to a Bellabeat product

**Goals/metrics:**  
To use insights to reveal growth opportunities

**Deliverables:**  
* Write a clear summary of the business task  
* A description of all data sources used  
* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data  
* Write a summary of the analysis  
* Present supporting visualisation and key findings  
* Make a high-level recommendation based on the analysis

The case study road map follows the data analytics process, Ask,
Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share.

### Ask

The problem here is finding trends in smart device usage. Any insights
gained will come from trends or patterns noticed in the data. This will
drive business decisions. The SMART reference was used while asking
questions. This ensures that the questions asked are Specific,
Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant and Time-bound.

**Key tasks:**  
* Identify the business task: The task is to gain insights into how
consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply those insights to a
Bellabeat product to help guide marketing strategy for the company  
* Consider key stakeholders: The key stakeholders are Urska Srsen,
Sando Mur, the Bellabeat marketing analytics team and the Bellabeat
customers.

**Deliverable:** A clear statement of the business task

### Prepare

Of the 18 .csv files from the available data we used 3 for the analysis
because they have the most data entries and would give a more accurate
representation. The datasets used:  
* dailyActivity_merged.csv  
* dailyCalories_merged.csv  
* SleepDay_merged.csv  
* hourlyIntensities_merged.csv  
* hourlySteps_merged.csv

**Where is the data stored?** The dataset used for this case study is
the Fitbit fitness tracker data stored in Kaggle and available through
Morbius

**How is the data organized?** There are 18 .csv files. The data within
is structured in a rows and columns schema. The data is organized in a
long format. This means that each row is a one-time point per subject.
It contains values (customer ID numbers) that repeat in the first
column.

**Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?** The dataset
was gathered from the personal data of about 30 participants who
consented to the use of their data. There is sampling bias because it is
quite a small sample size and it does not address all demographics, i.e
age. The data is also outdated since it was collected in the year 2016.

**How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security and
accessibility?** The data is CC0, a creative commons open-source
license. It intends to cover all copyright and database rights. Data in
the public domain are available to other users to reuse, enhance and
build upon without copyright and database law restrictions. The
participants of the survey from which the data was gathered also
consented to the submission of personal tracker data. No personal data
is contained in the data, hence privacy is maintained.

**How did you verify the data's integrity?** The data is stored on a
verified source – Kaggle. It was generated by respondents to a
distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk, making it third-party
data, which is considered unreliable. The data does not meet the
requirements to be considered ROCCC (Reliable Original Comprehensive
Current Cited).

**Are there any problems with the data?**  
The data is outdated and does not reflex current trends. There are
several missing values

**Key tasks:**  
* Download data and store it appropriately  
* Identify how it is organized  
* Sort and filter the data  
* Determine the credibility of the data

**Deliverables:**  
A description of all data sources used

### Process

**Tools**  
R was used for this analysis for its benefits of being a great tool for statistical analysis, accessibility, having good visualisation and can be reshared. The tool was used to transform, clean and visualise the data.

**What steps have you taken to ensure that the data is clean?**  
The data was checked for errors, blanks, duplicates, extra spaces, and consistent formats in date, number, date-time, etc.

The following steps were taken in transforming, cleaning, and visualising the data:

1. **Loading packages:** The tidyverse, lubridate, and ggplot2 packages were loaded for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Importing data:** The CSV files were uploaded to R Studio and read into data frames.

3. **Data exploration:** Tibbles containing summaries of the data and data structure of each data frame were viewed. This gave an idea of the columns, the data types and the kinds of trends that can be found in the data.

4. **Inconsistency check:** An inconsistency noticed in the daily_activity data frame made the team want to know how often users have their watches on. From the difference in time it can be assumed that those users do not use their devices all day. Another inconsistency was noticed where some users have 0 total steps recorded and zero calories burned.

**Cleaning**

* **Unique IDs:** The sample confirms there are 33 unique IDs in the activity and calories data, and 24 in the sleep data. Some data frames had insufficient data due to a lack of entry and were neglected.

* **Missing values:** The data frames being used are complete and do not contain any missing values.

* **Duplicates:** 3 duplicate records were found in the sleep data and removed.

* **Column naming:** The column names of the data frames used were renamed for consistency, putting them all in lower case.

* **Data formats:** The sleepday column was in date-time format and was converted to ensure all formats are consistent.

* **Data merging:** The daily activity data frame was merged with the daily sleep data frame by ID and date.

### Analyse

**Key tasks**

- Aggregate your data so it's useful and accessible.  
- Organize and format your data.  
- Perform calculations.  
- Identify trends and relationships

**Deliverable**  
A summary of the analysis

In this phase, the analysis revealed trends in the FitBit user data being worked with. This establishes how helpful the data is in coming up with a marketing strategy for our company.

**Assumption**  
In the absence of a demographic, a decision was made to categorise users based on steps taken per day. The categories according to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488109/):

- <5000 Sedentary lifestyle  
- 5000–7499 Physically inactive  
- 7500–9999 Moderately active  
- ≥10,000 Physically active  
- ≥12,500 Very active

**Average daily steps by user** were calculated and users were classified by lifestyle based on their average daily steps.

***What percentage of people are living each lifestyle?***

| User Lifestyle | Percentage |
|----------------|-----------|
| Moderately active | 37.5% |
| Physically active | 16.7% |
| Physically inactive | 20.8% |
| Sedentary lifestyle | 20.8% |
| Very active | 4.2% |

**Time of day most active:** Analysis was performed to determine what time of day users are more active.

***How are users using their devices?***

A calculation of the days users used their devices led the team to create a category by usage. This trend will be helpful in coming up with a marketing strategy for Bellabeat.

| Usage Category | Description | Percentage |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Frequent use | 21 to 31 days | 50% |
| Infrequent use | 1 to 10 days | 38% |
| Moderate use | 11 to 20 days | 12% |

**Device usage duration:** Analysis was performed to determine how long users wear their devices daily.

| Duration Worn | Percentage |
|---------------|-----------|
| All day | 36% |
| More than half day | 60% |
| Less than half day | 4% |

**What days are users more active and what days are they getting the most sleep?**

Knowing which days users are least and most active helps come up with solutions. Analysis reveals high active minutes but also reveals a low amount of sleep by users.

| Weekday | Avg Daily Active Mins | Avg Hours of Sleep |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Monday | 991 | 6.99 |
| Tuesday | 1007 | 6.74 |
| Wednesday | 960 | 7.24 |
| Thursday | 940 | 6.69 |
| Friday | 1002 | 6.76 |
| Saturday | 977 | 6.98 |
| Sunday | - | - |

**Daily Active Minutes vs Calories Burned**

Some users have more active minutes than others from the summation of the very active, fairly active, lightly active, and sedentary minutes. Using the sum of these minutes, it was determined that there is some correlation between the total daily active minutes and the calories burned.

**Daily Active Minutes and Sleep per Weekday**

According to the graph, users maintain high active minutes, Tuesday and Friday being the highest. Users appear to not be getting the recommended minutes of sleep according to the second chart. The recommended amount of sleep for an adult aged 18-60 years is 7+ hours according to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/). We do not have age data, but we assume that the users fall in this range. Individual variation in sleep need is influenced by genetic, behavioral, medical, and environmental factors, which we do not have.

### Summary and Recommendation

**Summary**

- The FitBit time piece serves a similar purpose as Bellabeat's Time and Leaf products. Thus, why we focused our analysis on its data.

- The analysis revealed that while some users maintain an active lifestyle, quite a lot maintain an inactive or sedentary lifestyle.

- The analysis revealed that a lot of steps are taken by noon (12pm-2pm) and evenings (6pm-7pm).

- A correlation is revealed between the daily/total steps and the amount of calories burned. It shows that higher calories are burned by those taking more steps.

- A correlation is revealed between the daily active minutes and calories burned. It shows that more calories are burned by users with higher active minutes.

- The analysis revealed that a high percentage of users (38%) did not use their devices frequently. A high percentage (62% combined) used their devices moderately and frequently.

- The analysis revealed that a good amount of users have their devices on for at least half a day.

- It is revealed that users are not getting enough sleep daily. Only one day of the week records a sufficient average of sleep hours.

**Recommendation**

- We have the Bellabeat Time and Leaf products, which track sleep and other vital data. A feature that lets users set a bedtime and a wake-up time will help them meet the recommended sleep hours. We should also consider doing a weekly summary of sleep hours to help our users adjust according to their needs.

- We should convince the users to wear and use their devices more often. We can lay emphasis on the kinds of data they can keep track of in all environments (dry or wet). Emphasis on the privacy of their data can encourage them.

- Daily reminders to take steps, exercise, sleep, etc. can help our users to be mindful of their activities. Helpful articles or short videos on the importance of these things could be of great benefit. We want to keep users active. We can collect data from the users on why they do not walk, stay active, or sleep enough, and come up with suggestions and help based on their responses.

- The data analysed did not reveal gender-specific information. Our business focuses on the wellness of women. I suggest we use specific data we have collected in this regard for a more accurate analysis.
