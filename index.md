## Summary

Founded in 2013 by Urska Srsen and Sando Mur, Bellabeats is a
tech-driven health and wellness company that manufactures smart products
to enable women to track their health and habits based on their
activity, stress, sleep and reproductive health. Srsen, the Chief
Creative officer, knows that growth opportunities would be revealed from
an analysis of Bellabeat’s customer data. She wants the marketing
analytics team, in which I am a junior data analyst to analyse usage
data of non-Bellabeat smart devices while focusing on a Bellabeat
product. The purpose is to gain insights into how those other devices
are being used by customers and apply the insights to the Bellabeat
product.

**Problem statement:**  
To analyse smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers
use smart devices and apply these insights to a Bellabeat product

**Goals/metrics:**  
To use insights to reveal growth opportunities

**Deliverables:**  
\* Write a clear summary of the business task  
\* A description of all data sources used  
\* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data  
\* Write a summary of the analysis  
\* Present supporting visualisation and key findings  
\* Make a high-level recommendation based on the analysis

The case study road map follows the data analytics process, Ask,
Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share.

### Ask

The problem here is finding trends in smart device usage. Any insights
gained will come from trends or patterns noticed in the data. This will
drive business decisions. The SMART reference was used while asking
questions. This ensures that the questions asked are Specific,
Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant and Time-bound.

**Key tasks:**  
\* Identify the business task: The task is to gain insights into how
consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply those insights to a
Bellabeat product to help guide marketing strategy for the company  
\* Consider key stakeholders: The key stakeholders are Urska Srsen,
Sando Mur, the Bellabeat marketing analytics team and the Bellabeat
customers.

**Deliverable:** A clear statement of the business task

### Prepare

Of the 18 .csv files from the available data we used 3 for the analysis
because they have the most data entries and would give a more accurate
representation. The datasets used:  
\* dailyActivity_merged.csv  
\* dailyCalories_merged.csv  
\* SleepDay_merged.csv  
\* hourlyIntensities_merged.csv  
\* hourlySteps_merged.csv

**Where is the data stored?** The dataset used for this case study is
the Fitbit fitness tracker data stored in Kaggle and available through
Morbius

**How is the data organized?** There are 18 .csv files. The data within
is structured in a rows and columns schema. The data is organized in a
long format. This means that each row is a one-time point per subject.
It contains values (customer ID numbers) that repeat in the first
column.

**Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data?** The dataset
was gathered from the personal data of about 30 participants who
consented to the use of their data. There is sampling bias because it is
quite a small sample size and it does not address all demographics, i.e
age. The data is also outdated since it was collected in the year 2016.

**How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security and
accessibility?** The data is CC0, a creative commons open-source
license. It intends to cover all copyright and database rights. Data in
the public domain are available to other users to reuse, enhance and
build upon without copyright and database law restrictions. The
participants of the survey from which the data was gathered also
consented to the submission of personal tracker data. No personal data
is contained in the data, hence privacy is maintained.

**How did you verify the data’s integrity?** The data is stored on a
verified source – Kaggle. It was generated by respondents to a
distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk, making it third-party
data, which is considered unreliable. The data does not meet the
requirements to be considered ROCCC (Reliable Original Comprehensive
Current Cited).

**Are there any problems with the data?**  
The data is outdated and does not reflex current trends. There are
several missing values

**Key tasks:**  
\* Download data and store it appropriately  
\* Identify how it is organized  
\* Sort and filter the data  
\* Determine the credibility of the data

**Deliverables:**  
A description of all data sources used

### Process

**Tools** I am using R for this analysis for its benefits of being a
great tool for statistical analysis, accessibility, having good
visualisation and can be reshared. The tool was used to transform, clean
and visualise the data.

**What steps have you taken to ensure that the data is clean?**  
I checked the data for errors, blanks, duplicates, extra spaces, and
consistent formats in date, number, date-time, etc.

The following are the steps taken in transforming, cleaning, and
visualising the data.

Load the packages. They are already installed and up to date.

The .csv files were downloaded and uploaded to R studio. The read_csv()
function was then used to read them. Of the 18 available files a few
have been used because they have more samples compared to the ones not
used. This decision was taken in order to have better results after
difficulties in obtaining more data.

**To view the data summary and structure.**

We view tibbles containing summaries of the data and also the data
structure of each data frame. This gives an idea of the columns, the
data types and the kinds of trends that can be found in the data.

An inconsistency noticed in the daily_activity data frame makes the team
want to know how often users have their watches on. From the difference
in time it can be assumed that those users do not use their devices all
day. More data needed.

    ## [1] 0

    ## [1] 462

Another inconsistency is noticed in the daily activity data frame. Some
users have 0 total steps recorded and zero calories burned. If more data
cannot be gathered to fill the gap it will be neglected.

**Cleaning**

Confirming the number of unique ids in the data. The sample below
confirms there are 33 unique Ids. Like with the daily_sleep data frame,
some others had insufficient data due to a lack of entry. For that
reason, they were neglected.

    ## [1] 33

    ## [1] 33

    ## [1] 24

**Missing values**

Checking for missing values. The data frames being used are complete and
do not contain any missing values.

    ## [1] 0

    ## [1] 0

    ## [1] 0

**Duplicates**

To find duplicates in each data frame

    ## [1] 0

    ## [1] 0

    ## [1] 3

Removing dublicates

Checking removal of duplicates in the daily_sleep data frame

    ## [1] 0

**Renaming columns**

The column names of the data frames used were renamed for consistency,
putting them all in lower case.

    ##  [1] "id"                       "activitydate"            
    ##  [3] "totalsteps"               "totaldistance"

    ##  [9] "lightactivedistance"      "sedentaryactivedistance" 
    ## [11] "veryactiveminutes"        "fairlyactiveminutes"     
    ## [13] "lightlyactiveminutes"     "sedentaryminutes"        
    ## [15] "calories"                 "minutes_total"

    ## [1] "id"          "activityday" "calories"

    ## [1] "id"                 "sleepday"           "totalsleeprecords" 
    ## [4] "totalminutesasleep" "totaltimeinbed"

**Data formats**

The sleepday column is of date-time format. It was converted to ensure
that all formats are consistent.

### Analyse

**Key tasks**

- Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible.  
- Organize and format your data.  
- Perform calculations.  
- Identify trends and relationships

**Deliverable**  
A summary of the analysis

In this phase, the analysis will reveal a trend in the FitBit user data
being worked with. This will establish how helpful the data is in coming
up with a marketing strategy for our company.

**Assumption**  
In the absence of a demographic we decided to gather additional data.
This leads to a decision to categorise users based on steps taken per
day. The categories according to the
[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488109/) :

- \<5000 Sedentary lifestyle  
- 5000–7499 Physically inactive  
- 7500–9999 Moderately active  
- ≥10,000 Physically active  
- ≥12,500 Very active

This was used to calculate the average daily steps for each user

**Time of day most active** Knowing what time of day users are more
active will help the analysis process.

***How are users using their devices?***

A calculation of the days users used their devices lead the team to
create a category by usage. This trend will be helpful in coming up with
a marketing strategy for Bellabeat. It shows that a rather high
percentage of users (38%) are not using their devices frequently. 50% of
users use them frequently and 12% use them moderately.

**What days are users more active and what days are they getting the
most sleep**

Knowing which days users are least and most active can help us come up
with a solution. A sleep pattern will also present great insight.
Analysis reveals high active minutes. It also reveals a low amount of
sleep by users.

The chart reveals that a total amount of users (58.4%) are quite
active - 4.2% very active, 16.7 physically active, and 37.5 moderately
active. A combined 41.6% are not too active - 20.8% both sedentary
lifestyle and physically inactive

**Correlation**

Established a correlation between daily steps and calories burned. The
chart revealed that the most calories are burned on average by users
taking more steps.

**Period of steps**

Viz for hourly steps per user. The result shows that a lot of steps are
taken by the users during midday and/ or evenings.

**Total active minutes vs calories**

Some users have more active minutes than others from the summation of
the ‘veryactiveminutes’, ‘fairlyactiveminutes’, ‘lightlyactiveminutes’,
and ‘sedentaryminutes’ attributes. Using the sum of these minutes, it
was determined that there is some correlation between the total daily
active minutes and the calories burned.

**Most active days by total active minutes**

According to the graph, users maintain high active minutes, Tuesday and
Friday being the highest. Users appear to not be getting the recommended
minutes of sleep according to the second chart. The recommended amount
of sleep for an adult aged 18 - 60years is 7hours+ according to
[link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434546/#:~:text=Current%20evidence%20supports%20the%20general,%2C%20medical%2C%20and%20environmental%20factors.).
We do not have age data, but we assume that the users fall in this
range. According to the same source, Individual variation in sleep need
is influenced by genetic, behavioral, medical, and environmental
factors, which we do not have.

### Summary and Recommendation

**Summary**

- The FitBit time piece serves a similar purpose as Bellabeat’s Time and
  Leaf products. Thus, why we focused our analysis on its data.

- The analysis revealed that while some users maintain an active life
  style, quite a lot maintain an inactive or sedentary lifestyle.

- The analysis revealed that a lot of steps are taken by noon (12pm-2pm)
  and evenings (6pm-7pm).

- A correlations is revealed between the daily/ total steps and the
  amount of calories burned. It shows that higher calories are burned by
  those taking more steps.

- A correlation is revealed between the daily active minutes and
  calories burned. It shows that more calories are burned by users with
  higher active minutes.

- The analysis revealed that a high percentage of users (38%) did not
  use their devices frequently. A high percentage (62% combined) used
  their devices moderately and frequently.

- The analysis revealed that a good amount of users have their devices
  on for at least half a day.

- It is revealed that users are not getting enough sleep daily. Only one
  day of the week records a sufficient average of sleep hours.

**Recommendation**

- We have the Bellabeat Time and Leaf products, which track sleep and
  other vital data. A feature that lets users set a bedtime and a
  wake-up time will help them meet the recommended sleep hours. We
  should also consider doing a weekly summary of sleep hours to help our
  users adjust according to their needs.

- We should convince the users to wear and use their devices more often.
  We can lay emphasis on the kinds of data they can keep track of in all
  environments (dry or wet). Emphases on the privacy of their data can
  encourage them.

- Daily reminders to take steps, exercise, sleep, etc. can help our
  users to be mindful of their activities. Helpful articles or short
  videos on the importance of these things could be of great benefit.  
  We want to keep users active. We can collect data from the users on
  why if for any reason they do not walk, stay active, or sleep enough,
  and come up with suggestions and help based on their responses. They
  do pay a fine subscription after all hahaha

- The data analysed did not reveal gender-specific information. Our
  business focuses on the wellness of women. I suggest we use specific
  data we have collected in this regard for a more accurate analysis.
